# 🍋 Lemonade Arcade

![Lemonade Arcade Banner](./img/banner.png)

An AI-powered game generator and arcade that creates playable Python games using LLMs.

## Overview

Lemonade Arcade combines the convenience of a ChatGPT-like interface with the concept of a game emulator. Instead of emulating existing games, it uses LLMs (served by [Lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade)) to generate completely new games based on your prompts, then lets you play them instantly.

## Features

- **Lemonade integration**: automatically connects to Lemonade Server and has access to any Lemonade LLM.
- **AI Game Generation**: Describe a game concept and watch as an LLM creates a playable Python game.
- **Game Library**: All generated games are saved and can be replayed anytime.
- **Easy Management**: View game source code, copy prompts for remixing, and delete games you don't want with a simple click.

## Requirements

### LLM and Hardware

We strongly recommend using code-tuned models size 24B and larger. Look for the "CODING" label in the Lemonade model manager.

To run these, you will need a computer with at least 32 GB of system RAM and/or 16 GB of VRAM.

### Software

- Python 3.8 or higher ([Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) recommended).
- [Lemonade Server](https://lemonade-server.ai) installed and running, with at least one model downloaded.
- Chromium-based web browser.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade
   cd lemonade-arcade
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Make sure Lemonade Server is running with at least one coding LLM installed.

## Usage

1. Start Lemonade Arcade:
   ```bash
   lemonade-arcade
   ```

2. The application will automatically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. Check that the status indicator shows Lemonade Server is online (🍋).

4. Select a model from the dropdown.

5. Enter a game description in the prompt box, for example:
   - "Create a snake game but the food moves around"
   - "Make space invaders with rainbow colors"
   - "Build a simple platformer where you collect coins"

6. Click "Create Game" and watch the magic happen!

7. Once generated, the game will automatically launch and be added to your library.

8. Click any game in your library to play it again.

9. Hover over games and click the X button to delete games you no longer want. Right click games to get their Python source code and prompt.

## Game Generation

Games are generated with the following constraints:
- Pure Python using the pygame library only.
- No external images, sounds, or asset files.
- Complete and playable with proper game mechanics.
- Proper event handling and game loops.
- Visual appeal using pygame's built-in drawing functions.

> Note: LLMs are imperfect, and may fail to generate the game you asked for or fail to generate a functioning game at all. Code-tuned LLMs of size 24B or larger are strongly recommended.

## Game Cache

Games are cached under the `.lemonade-arcade` folder in your home directory.

```
~/.lemonade-arcade/
└── games/
    ├── metadata.json    # Game titles and descriptions
    ├── abc12345.py      # Generated game files
    └── xyz67890.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Server Offline" Status
- Ensure Lemonade Server is running on `http://localhost:8000`.
- Check that you have models installed in Lemonade Server by opening the model manager: http://localhost:8000/#model-management.
- Visit [lemonade-server.ai](https://lemonade-server.ai) for setup instructions.

### Game Won't Launch
- Check the generated code for any syntax errors.
- Try regenerating the game with a more specific prompt.

### Generation Failures
- Try a simpler game concept.
- Make sure your selected model supports code generation.
- Check the `lemonade-arcade` and Lemonade Server logs for errors.

## Examples

Here are some example prompts that work well:

- **Classic Games**: "pong", "tetris", "pacman maze game", "asteroids"
- **Variations**: "snake but food teleports", "breakout with power-ups", "flappy bird in space"
- **Original Ideas**: "catching falling stars", "color matching puzzle", "maze with moving walls"
