# LemonadeClient API Reference

The `LemonadeClient` class provides a comprehensive interface for integrating with lemonade-server in your applications. It handles installation, configuration, server management, and model operations with cross-platform compatibility.

## Suggested Workflow

Here's the typical sequence of API calls for setting up a lemonade-server-based application:

### 1. Initial Setup and Environment Check
```python
from lemonade_arcade.lemonade_client import LemonadeClient

client = LemonadeClient()

# Check deployment environment
is_pyinstaller = client.is_pyinstaller_environment()

# Check if SDK is available (for development environments)
sdk_available = await client.check_lemonade_sdk_available()
```

### 2. Installation Status Check
```python
# Check if lemonade-server is installed and compatible
version_info = await client.check_lemonade_server_version()
if not version_info["installed"] or not version_info["compatible"]:
    # Need to install or upgrade
    result = await client.download_and_install_lemonade_server()
    if result["success"]:
        # Refresh environment after installation
        client.refresh_environment()
        client.reset_server_state()
```

### 3. Server Management
```python
# Check if server is running
is_running = await client.check_lemonade_server_running()
if not is_running:
    # Start the server
    start_result = await client.start_lemonade_server()
    
# Verify API connectivity
api_online = await client.check_lemonade_server_api()
```

### 4. Model Management
```python
required_model = "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF"

# Check if model is installed
model_status = await client.check_model_installed(required_model)
if not model_status["installed"]:
    # Install the model
    install_result = await client.install_model(required_model)

# Check if model is loaded
load_status = await client.check_model_loaded(required_model)
if not load_status["loaded"]:
    # Load the model
    load_result = await client.load_model(required_model)
```

### 5. Ready for Inference
Once the above steps complete successfully, your application can make inference requests to `client.url` (default: `http://localhost:8000`) using the OpenAI-compatible API.

## API Reference

### Environment and System Detection

#### `is_pyinstaller_environment()`
Check if the application is running in a PyInstaller bundle environment.

**When to use:** Determine installation method preferences or adjust behavior based on deployment type. PyInstaller environments typically prefer installer-based server installation over pip.

**Returns:** `bool` - True if running in PyInstaller bundle, False otherwise

**Example:**
```python
if client.is_pyinstaller_environment():
    print("Running as packaged executable")
    # Prefer installer-based installation
else:
    print("Running in development environment") 
    # Can use pip installation
```

---

#### `find_lemonade_server_paths()`
Find lemonade-server installation paths by scanning the system PATH.

**When to use:** Discover where lemonade-server binaries are installed on the system. Helpful for apps that need to verify installation locations or debug path issues.

**Returns:** `List[str]` - List of directory paths containing lemonade-server installations

**Example:**
```python
paths = client.find_lemonade_server_paths()
print(f"Found lemonade-server in: {paths}")
```

---

#### `refresh_environment()`
Refresh environment variables from the system registry (Windows only).

**When to use:** After installing lemonade-server to pick up newly added PATH entries without requiring an application restart. Essential for apps that install lemonade-server programmatically and need immediate access to the commands.

**Example:**
```python
# After installation
await client.download_and_install_lemonade_server()
client.refresh_environment()  # Pick up new PATH entries
client.reset_server_state()   # Clear cached commands
```

---

#### `reset_server_state()`
Reset cached server state after installation changes or configuration updates.

**When to use:** Call this when you've installed/updated lemonade-server or changed system configuration to ensure the client rediscovers server commands and processes. Essential after installation operations to avoid using stale cached paths.

**Example:**
```python
# After any installation or configuration change
client.reset_server_state()
```

---

### Core Server Operations

#### `execute_lemonade_server_command(args, timeout=10, use_popen=False, stdout_file=None, stderr_file=None)`
Execute lemonade-server commands using the best available method for the system.

**When to use:** As the primary interface for running any lemonade-server command. The method automatically tries different installation methods (pip, installer, dev) and caches the successful command for future use. Essential for cross-platform compatibility.

**Parameters:**
- `args: List[str]` - Command arguments to pass to lemonade-server (e.g., `["--version"]`, `["serve"]`)
- `timeout: int` - Maximum seconds to wait for command completion (ignored for background processes)
- `use_popen: bool` - True for background processes that shouldn't block, False for commands with output
- `stdout_file` - File handle to redirect standard output (only with use_popen=True)
- `stderr_file` - File handle to redirect error output (only with use_popen=True)

**Returns:** `subprocess.CompletedProcess` for regular commands, `subprocess.Popen` for background processes, or `None` if all command attempts failed

**Example:**
```python
# Check version
result = await client.execute_lemonade_server_command(["--version"])
if result:
    print(f"Version: {result.stdout}")

# Start server in background
process = await client.execute_lemonade_server_command(
    ["serve"], 
    use_popen=True
)
```

**When to use:** Discover which models are installed and available for use. Helpful for displaying model options to users or verifying that required models are available before attempting to use them.

**Returns:** `List[str]` - List of model names/IDs available on the server, empty list if none found

**Example:**
```python
models = await client.get_available_models()
print(f"Available models: {models}")
for model in models:
    print(f"  - {model}")
```

---

#### `check_model_installed(model)`

**Example:**
```python
required_model = "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF"
status = await client.check_model_installed(required_model)
if status["installed"]:
    print(f"Model {required_model} is available")
else:
    print(f"Need to install {required_model}")
    await client.install_model(required_model)
```

---

#### `check_model_loaded(model)`

- `current_model: str` - Name of currently loaded model (may be different)

**Example:**
```python
required_model = "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF"
status = await client.check_model_loaded(required_model)
if status["loaded"]:
    print(f"Model {required_model} is ready for inference")
else:
    current = status["current_model"]
    print(f"Current model: {current}, need to load {required_model}")
    await client.load_model(required_model)
```

---

#### `install_model(model)`
Download and install a model on the lemonade-server.

**When to use:** Install models that your app requires but aren't currently available on the server. The installation process may take several minutes for large models and requires an active internet connection.

**Parameters:**

**Returns:** `dict` with keys:
- `success: bool` - Whether installation succeeded
- `message: str` - Success message or error details

**Example:**
```python
model_name = "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF"
print(f"Installing {model_name}...")
result = await client.install_model(model_name)
if result["success"]:
    print("Model installed successfully")
else:
    print(f"Installation failed: {result['message']}")
```

---

#### `load_model(model)`
Load a model into memory for inference operations.

**When to use:** Prepare an installed model for use. Models must be loaded before they can handle chat completions or other inference requests. Only one model can be loaded at a time.

**Parameters:**
- `model: str` - The model name/ID to load (e.g., "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF")

**Returns:** `dict` with keys:
- `success: bool` - Whether model loaded successfully
- `message: str` - Success message or error details

**Example:**
```python
model_name = "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF"
print(f"Loading {model_name}...")
result = await client.load_model(model_name)
if result["success"]:
    print("Model loaded and ready for inference")
    # Can now make API calls to client.url
else:
    print(f"Loading failed: {result['message']}")
```

---

## Error Handling

Most methods return dictionaries with `success` and `message` keys for operations, or boolean values for status checks. Always check return values:

```python
# For operations
result = await client.start_lemonade_server()
if not result["success"]:
    print(f"Operation failed: {result['message']}")
    return

# For status checks  
if not await client.check_lemonade_server_api():
    print("Server API is not responding")
    return
```
